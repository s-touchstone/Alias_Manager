# Linux Permanent Alias Manager
This program is designed to be an application run from the command line that
allows you to create, edit, delete, and lookup your own permanent aliases. By
permanent I mean that they wont dissappear after a shutdown or a logout. It does
this by creating a space for custom aliases in the '~/.bashrc' file without
overwriting its original information. It appends an area to the end of the file
in which the aliases will be stored. The custom aliases can be modified at any
time if a mistake is made in syntax or if you want to change the alias's name.
It is a very simple tool to use.
